            <h4>Touch once a day, at least</h4>
            <p>Don't let a day pass without at least a few minutes of working on your project, watching a tutorial/coding along, or even just reviewing or reading up on a recent subject.</p>

            <p>There's power in familiarity and even on days when you have sooo much going on, taking a couple of minutes to review will go a LONG way with retention.</p>

            <h4>If stuck, don't abort</h4>
            <p>If you get stuck and don't know what to do next, try these 3 things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Move on to the next 1 or 2 progressive lessons (just watch/ read, don't practice using the code you're stuck with or build on top of what's not working.) WHY? Well, sometimes having the extra insight from the next one or two steps helps you get context and clarity about your stuck step. Sounds crazy, but it will alleviate your frustration a little but and give you the important feeling of still making progress. That way you don't feel like you're stuck at a roadblock that you can't get around. Where you're stuck will look more like a little issue that you need more information to work thorugh.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Revisit the past one or more lessons. There could be something fundamental that you missed that could be the source of your issue. Don't rush, make sure you covered everyting. Re-start some of the projects in seprataely named folders and see if you end up re-creating that same issue or not. If not- then you found the issue- if you don't underststand where, compare the 2 project's code files.
                </li>
                <li> Find another learning resource that covers the same topic and spend a few minutes reading. Do this 2-3 times to see if a different explanation helps you understand what you're stuck with.</li>

            </ol>
